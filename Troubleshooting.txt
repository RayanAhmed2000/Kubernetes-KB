GENERAL DEBUGGING
-----------------
Kubectl get logs <podname> view logs
kubectl get events 

 If there’s a problem with the scheduler, it could prevent Pods from being scheduled. You can check the scheduler’s logs with the 
kubectl logs <scheduler-pod-name> -n kube-system 


check events
check pod logs
check scheduler pod logs
check node affinity taint and tolerations pvc image name 


PENDING STATE
-------------
“Pending” status for a Pod means that the Pod has been accepted by the K8s system, but it hasn’t been scheduled for running on a node yet
REASONS
- resource crunch
- taint and tolerations
- node affinity
- pvc : if pod is dependent on PV and the pv is not ready 
- init container
- image pull back error
- Kubescheduler ka pod that is on master node is not running


CRASH LOOP BACK
---------------
Insufficient resources—lack of resources prevents the container from loading
Locked file/database/port—a resource already locked by another container
Config loading/Setup error—a server cannot load the configuration file or initial setup like init-container failing
Liveness probes– Liveness probes could have misconfigured or probe fails due to any reason.
Kubeproxy error
