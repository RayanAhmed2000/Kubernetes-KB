GENERAL DEBUGGING
-----------------
Kubectl logs <podname> view logs
kubectl get events 

 If there’s a problem with the scheduler, it could prevent Pods from being scheduled. You can check the scheduler’s logs with the 
kubectl logs <scheduler-pod-name> -n kube-system 


check events
check pod logs
check scheduler pod logs
check node affinity taint and tolerations pvc image name 


PENDING STATE
-------------
“Pending” status for a Pod means that the Pod has been accepted by the K8s system, but it hasn’t been scheduled for running on a node yet
REASONS
- resource crunch
- taint and tolerations
- node affinity
- pvc : if pod is dependent on PV and the pv is not ready 
- init container
- image pull back error
- Kubescheduler ka pod that is on master node is not running


CRASH LOOP BACK
---------------
Insufficient resources—lack of resources prevents the container from loading
Locked file/database/port—a resource already locked by another container
Config loading/Setup error—a server cannot load the configuration file or initial setup like init-container failing
Liveness probes– Liveness probes could have misconfigured or probe fails due to any reason.
Kubeproxy error




PVC Trouble shooting
--------------------
Following three issues can occur
Persistent Volume creation issue: Kubernetes had a problem creating the persistent volume or enabling access to it, even though the underlying storage resources exist.
Persistent Volume provisioning issue: Kubernetes could not create the required persistent volume because storage resources were unavailable.
Changes in specs: Kubernetes had a problem connecting a pod to the required Persistent Volume because of a configuration change in the PV or PVC.

Reasons - 
FailedAttachVolume - pichle node se detach hoke ye wale node pe attach nahi ho paa rahi hai Volume
FailedMount - Jab volume mount nahi ho paegi right path pe Agar FailedAttachVolume aega matlb ye bi ana hai 
CrashLoopBackOff caused by PersistentVolume Claim - 

Since Kubernetes can’t automatically handle the FailedAttachVolume and FailedMount errors on its own, sometimes you have to take manual steps.
