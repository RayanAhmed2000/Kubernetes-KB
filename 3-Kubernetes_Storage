In kubernetes we need a persistent volume
if we have a databse in a pod and it restarts then all databse data is gone.
  so we need a storage that does not depend on the pod lifecycle i.e. it lies outside the pod
  also we dont know on which node our pod will restart so that storage must be available to all nodes in the cluster
  storage is like a plugin to kubernetes cluster wether local or remote like EBS or Google Cloud storage
  they are not scoped to a particular namespace they are accessible to the whole cluster

  
We can create PV from yaml file.


Kubernetes Volume

PV AND PVC is not in EKS 

1- PV (Persistent Volume) -> it contains the storage server information 
  2- pvc (Persistant Volume claim) -> it is request for PV that end user or application makes 

pv is a persisstemnt volume it contains storage srver information
without pv we cannot create pvc
5 gb ka pv banaya
3 gb ka pvc aya to use pv se bound kardia

Volume provisioning types
1 static -> we need to manually create pv 
2 dynamic -> all the information of storage server we provide to API, API creates pv automatically

acccess modes in pv->

1 ReadWriteOnce -> 1 time pe 1 node ke kitne bhi POD Readwrite kar skte 
2 ReadWriteMany -> 1 time pe sare nodes ke saare pod ReadWrite kar skte
3 ReadOnlyMany -> Sirf aur sirf read kar skte hain
4 ReadWriteOncePOD - > Ek time pe ek hi POD 

PVReclaimPolicy
1 Recycle
2 Retain
3 Deleted

pv status 

1 Available -> not attahced to a pvc
2 Released -> attached tha lekin pvc delete hogya
3 bound -> attached hai

NOTE
1 pv only 1 pvc se attached ho skta hai
pv -> clustrer level
pvc -> namespace level
