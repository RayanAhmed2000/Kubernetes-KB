In kubernetes we need a persistent volume
if we have a databse in a pod and it restarts then all databse data is gone.
  so we need a storage that does not depend on the pod lifecycle i.e. it lies outside the pod
  also we dont know on which node our pod will restart so that storage must be available to all nodes in the cluster
  storage is like a plugin to kubernetes cluster wether local or remote like EBS or Google Cloud storage
  they are not scoped to a particular namespace they are accessible to the whole cluster

Persistent Kyun?
POD gya storage gyi
Node gya storage gyi / Kisi aur Node pe schedule hogya pod storage ni access kar paega dusre node ki

is liye aesa storage jo saare pods aur aur node access kar payen -> PERSISTENT STORAGE


We can create PV from yaml file.
PV us storage ka description hai jo hum cluster me use karenge it can be on AWS S3/EBS or Google Cloud or even On-Prem Storage
"a piece of storage provisioned by an administrator that lies outside the cluster"
PVC is a request jo ki pod karta hai to use the PV
"a request for storage by a user or application. It's a way for Pods to consume persistent storage"


Kubernetes Volume -> PV AND PVC is not in EKS 

1- PV (Persistent Volume) -> it contains the storage server information 
  2- pvc (Persistant Volume claim) -> it is request for PV that end user or application makes 

pv is a persisstemnt volume it contains storage srver information
without pv we cannot create pvc
5 gb ka pv banaya
3 gb ka pvc aya to use pv se bound kardia
Kubectl get pvc karoge to 5 GB ka hi size dikhaega PVC ka and use bi kar paenge 5GB this is because PVC and PV ka size and accessmode should be same

Volume provisioning types
1 static -> we need to manually create pv 
2 dynamic -> all the information of storage server we provide to API, API creates pv automatically according to requirement

acccess modes in pv->

1 ReadWriteOnce -> 1 time pe 1 Node ke saare PODS Read write karne ke liye access kar skte hain us volume ko
2 ReadWriteMany -> 1 time pe saare NODES ke saare PODS Read write karne ke liye access karenge (NOT Recommednded Corrupt hone ke chances)
3 ReadOnlyMany -> Multiple PODS ek saath Sirf read karenge
4 ReadWriteOncePOD - > Ek time pe ek hi POD read write karega kyunki 1 ReadWriteOnce me bi corruption chances they jab 100+ pods chalte hain ek node pe

PVReclaimPolicy - If PVC is deleted then uske data ka kya karna hai? Jo PV me pada hua hai
1 Recycle - pvc delete kardia to pv will delete the data which pvc has written and get attached to another pvc.
2 Retain - Us ko save rakho admin manually hataega usko 
3 Deleted - PVC delete ho gya to PV bhi delete ho jaega

pv status 

1 Available -> not attahced to a pvc
2 Released -> attached tha lekin pvc delete hogya
3 bound -> attached hai

NOTE
1 pv only 1 pvc se attached ho skta hai
pv -> clustrer level
pvc -> namespace level 



Q - Same name ki 2 PV bana skte hain?
NO Cluster level scope hota hai PV ka

Q - PVC same name ki bnaa sket hain?
Han alag alag namespace me
Namespace level scope hota hai iska
